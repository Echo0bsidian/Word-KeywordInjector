# Word-KeywordInjector

**Word-KeywordInjector** is a VBA-powered automation tool for Microsoft Word that discreetly embeds user-defined keywords into document footers. Originally developed to support advanced resume optimization strategies, it helps align documents with Applicant Tracking System (ATS) filters by increasing keyword presence‚Äîwithout altering visible layout or design.

# Word-KeywordInjector

**Word-KeywordInjector** is a simple tool that helps you add hidden keywords to your Word document. It‚Äôs especially useful for resumes‚Äîmaking sure your document includes important terms that job systems (like ATS) look for, without changing how your resume looks.

## ‚ú® What It Does

- Lets you enter keywords (like ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù, ‚ÄúProject Management‚Äù, etc.)
- Adds those keywords to the footer of your document
- Makes the text invisible by using white font, tiny size, and hidden formatting
- Keeps your resume clean and professional-looking

## üìã Why Use It?

Many job applications are scanned by software before a human ever sees them. These systems look for keywords that match the job description. This tool helps you include those keywords in your resume‚Äîeven if they don‚Äôt fit naturally into your visible text.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It (Step-by-Step)

You don‚Äôt need to be technical. Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open the Macro Editor
1. Open your Word document.
2. Click the **View** tab at the top.
3. Click **Macros**, then choose **View Macros**.
4. In the box that appears, type a name like `InsertHiddenKeywordsInFooters`.
5. Click **Create**.

### Step 2: Paste the Code
1. A new window will open (this is the macro editor).
2. Delete anything in the box and **paste the macro code** from this project.
3. Press `Ctrl + S` to save.

### Step 3: Run the Macro
1. Go back to Word.
2. Click **View > Macros > View Macros** again.
3. Select `InsertHiddenKeywordsInFooters` and click **Run**.
4. Enter your keywords when prompted (separated by commas).

That‚Äôs it! The keywords are now hidden in your document‚Äôs footer.

### Optional: Reveal the Keywords Later
If you want to see the hidden keywords in your document:

Open your Word document.
1. Go to the File tab (top left corner).
2. Click Options at the bottom of the menu.
3. In the Word Options window, click Display on the left.
